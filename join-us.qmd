### Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS)

The **HKPFS**, administered by the **Hong Kong Research Grants Council (RGC)**, is the most prestigious award for PhD study in Hong Kong.

It provides:\
- **HK \$28,400 per month (≈ US \$3,630)** for up to three years (HKU may extend support to a fourth year if needed).\
- **HK \$14,200 per year (≈ US \$1,820)** in conference and research-travel allowance.

This fellowship targets applicants with a **strong academic record**, **demonstrated research experience**, and **excellent communication skills**.\
All HKPFS applicants to HKU are automatically considered for the complementary **HKU Presidential PhD Scholar Programme (HKU-PS)**.

> 🗓️ **Application deadline (HKPFS):** December 1^st^ each year (for admission in September of the following year).\
> Applicants must first register with the RGC and then submit their PhD application to HKU (see detailed guidelines below).

### HKU Presidential PhD Scholar Programme (HKU-PS)

![](Images/P1012082.JPG){.join-inline-left alt="Fieldwork with HKU students"}

All HKPFS awardees at HKU also receive the **HKU-PS Scholarship**, which provides additional benefits, including:\
- A **cash award of HK \$40,000 (≈ US \$5,100)** in Year 1 and **HK \$20,000 (≈ US \$2,550)** per year thereafter.\
- A **guaranteed hall residence** during the first year, with the possibility of renewal.

Exceptional PhD applicants who do not receive the HKPFS may still be offered the **HKU-PS** as an internal university-level entrance award.

> **Note:** Applicants do **not** need to apply separately for the HKPFS and the HKU-PS.\
> When applying for a full-time PhD at HKU, eligible candidates who apply for the HKPFS will be automatically considered for both awards.\
> Those not selected for the HKPFS remain eligible for admission and support under the HKU-PS or the standard **Postgraduate Studentship (PGS)** - see below.

> 🗓️ **Application deadline (HKU-PS Main Round):** December 1^st^ each year (for admission in September of the following year).\
> Late applications may be considered under the Rolling Admission system until April.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Postgraduate Studentship (PGS)

![](Images/Natasha-Hinojosa.jpeg){.join-inline-right alt="Lab member conducting research"}

The **PGS** is the standard funding package awarded upon admission to eligible full-time MPhil and PhD students who are not supported by HKPFS or HKU-PS.

It provides a **monthly stipend of approximately HK \$19,000 (≈ US \$2,430)** to support living expenses for the duration of study.

Applicants holding at least a Second Class Honours (First Division) or equivalent in their first degree (or a relevant Master’s) are eligible.\
You do not apply separately for the PGS. Admission to a full-time research degree automatically includes consideration for this studentship.

> 🗓️ **Application deadline (PGS/General PhD Admission):** December 1^st^ each year (for admission in September of the following year).\
> Late applications are accepted until **April**, but early submission increases chances of funding.

The same eligibility standards apply: a strong academic record (GPA \> 3.5) and prior research experience.
