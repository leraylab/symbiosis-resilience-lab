    "text": "IstmoBiome\n\nThe evolution of host associated microbiomes separated by the Isthmus of Panama\nThe closure of the Isthmus of Panama, approximately 3 million years ago, presents an unrivaled opportunity to study processes of diversification and adaptation in the sea. An ancient ocean was split up into the Pacific and the Caribbean Sea, two environments with strikingly different geophysical characteristics. Populations of animals, plants and their microbial symbionts got separated and followed separate evolutionary trajectories in response to new and contrasting environments: the Caribbean became warmer, saltier and nutrient poor, whereas the Tropical Eastern Pacific became more acidic with seasonal fluctuations in temperature and nutrients caused by upwelling of deep water when trade-winds blow.\nExtensive studies have used this natural experiment to examine evolutionary processes relating to molecular divergence and speciation of shallow-water marine macro-organisms in the two oceans, using pairs of sister species, one in the Western Atlantic (WA) and one TEP. In contrast to the macrofauna and flora, nothing was known about how the isthmian divergence has shaped the evolution of the microbiomes of sister hosts.\n\n\nObjectives\nWe take advantage of the isthmian experiment, leveraging extensive studies on the marine biology of hosts and their environments, to address key questions relating to the evolutionary divergence of marine microbiomes in changing environments and their functional significance such as:\n\nWhat is the contribution of host phylogenetic relatedness, host traits such as diet or behavior, and environmental factors in shaping the structure of marine microbiomes in sister hosts from two different oceans?\n\n\n\nWhich microbes co-evolve with their hosts across the isthmus, indicating a long-term association? What is the functional significance of these co-diverging microbes and their potential roles in host adaptation and ecological interactions?\n\n\n\nHow do host-associated microbes adapted to the distinct environmental conditions in the WA and TEP, and what are the potential mechanisms underlying their adaptation? Is there evidence for convergent evolution of microbiomes in response to similar environmental pressures in different geographic locations?\n\n\n\nHow do microbial symbionts influence hosts’ resistance and resilience to environmental changes? Do symbionts associating with hosts in one ocean provide greater resilience and adaptability to environmental fluctuations than symbionts in the other ocean? And what are the underlying mechanisms behind these differences?"

    "text": "We are always looking for motivated, collaborative, and creative students to join the Symbiosis & Resilience Lab at the University of Hong Kong (HKU).\nAll interested applicants should email Dr. Matthieu Leray (leraym@hku.hk) with a brief description of their research interests, academic background, and CV before submitting an application. Early contact is strongly encouraged to discuss potential projects and funding opportunities.\n\n\nWe seek students who are curious, responsible, and enthusiastic about collaborative research in marine ecology and evolution.\n\nDegree: BSc or MPhil in Biology (preferably with coursework in marine ecology/biology).\nAcademic record: ideally a GPA &gt; 3.5 to be competitive for postgraduate fellowships and demonstrated research experience.\nTeamwork: Excellent communication and interpersonal skills; ability to work well with others and contribute to a positive, inclusive lab culture.\nIndependence: High motivation and capacity to work independently; students who take initiative and think creatively.\nAdaptability: Willingness to learn new skills, work across disciplines, and apply a range of field and laboratory tools (not limited to molecular methods).\nBackground: Experience in marine ecology and/or bioinformatics is desirable.\nFieldwork: Willingness to conduct fieldwork, sometimes in remote tropical locations.\nDiving: Scuba diving certification is an asset but not required.\nLanguage: Proficiency in English (spoken and written).\n\nHighly qualified applicants (typically GPA &gt; 3.5 and with prior research experience) are encouraged to apply for competitive postgraduate fellowships, with a strong emphasis on recruiting international students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe HKPFS, administered by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (RGC), is the most prestigious award for PhD study in Hong Kong.\nIt provides:\n- HK $28,400 per month (≈ US $3,630) for up to three years (HKU may extend support to a fourth year if needed).\n- HK $14,200 per year (≈ US $1,820) in conference and research-travel allowance.\nThis fellowship targets applicants with a strong academic record, demonstrated research experience, and excellent communication skills.\nAll HKPFS applicants to HKU are automatically considered for the complementary HKU Presidential PhD Scholar Programme (HKU-PS).\n\n🗓️ Application deadline (HKPFS): December 1st each year (for admission in September of the following year).\nApplicants must first register with the RGC and then submit their PhD application to HKU (see detailed guidelines below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll HKPFS awardees at HKU also receive the HKU-PS Scholarship, which provides additional benefits, including:\n- A cash award of HK $40,000 (≈ US $5,100) in Year 1 and HK $20,000 (≈ US $2,550) per year thereafter.\n- A guaranteed hall residence during the first year, with the possibility of renewal.\nExceptional PhD applicants who do not receive the HKPFS may still be offered the HKU-PS as an internal university-level entrance award.\n\nNote: Applicants do not need to apply separately for the HKPFS and the HKU-PS.\nWhen applying for a full-time PhD at HKU, eligible candidates who apply for the HKPFS will be automatically considered for both awards.\nThose not selected for the HKPFS remain eligible for admission and support under the HKU-PS or the standard Postgraduate Studentship (PGS) - see below.\n\n\n🗓️ Application deadline (HKU-PS Main Round): December 1st each year (for admission in September of the following year).\nLate applications may be considered under the Rolling Admission system until April.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PGS is the standard funding package awarded upon admission to eligible full-time MPhil and PhD students who are not supported by HKPFS or HKU-PS.\nIt provides a monthly stipend of approximately HK $19,000 (≈ US $2,430) to support living expenses for the duration of study.\nApplicants holding at least a Second Class Honours (First Division) or equivalent in their first degree (or a relevant Master’s) are eligible.\nYou do not apply separately for the PGS. Admission to a full-time research degree automatically includes consideration for this studentship.\n\n🗓️ Application deadline (PGS/General PhD Admission): December 1st each year (for admission in September of the following year).\nLate applications are accepted until April, but early submission increases chances of funding.\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents who have secured external fellowships or sponsorships are also welcome to join the lab.\nThe same eligibility standards apply: a strong academic record (GPA &gt; 3.5) and prior research experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nApplicants interested in joining the Symbiosis & Resilience Lab at HKU should apply through the University of Hong Kong’s online PhD or MPhil admission system.\nAll eligible applicants are automatically considered for the available funding opportunities — you do not need to submit separate forms for each scholarship. Below are step-by-step guidelines.\n\n\n\n\nRegister and apply through the official RGC portal:\n👉 https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/apply.html\n\nYou may select up to two universities and specify your preferred PhD programs.\n\nAfter submission, you will receive an HKPFS Reference Number (e.g., PF26-XXXXX).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete the HKU online application for the PhD or MPhil programme and, if applicable, include your HKPFS Reference Number.\n\nHKU will automatically link your applications and consider you for:\n\nthe HKPFS (funded by the RGC),\n\nthe HKU Presidential PhD Scholar Programme (HKU-PS) top-up package, and\n\nthe Postgraduate Studentship (PGS), HKU’s standard studentship awarded upon admission to eligible full-time research students. \n\n\n\nNote: Applicants do not need to apply separately for the HKPFS and the HKU-PS.\nAll eligible candidates applying for the HKPFS through the RGC and listing HKU as a preferred university will be automatically considered for both awards.\nThose who are not selected for the HKPFS or HKU-PS remain eligible for support under the PGS.\nEarly contact with a potential supervisor is strongly encouraged, as HKPFS nominations must be supported by the host department."
