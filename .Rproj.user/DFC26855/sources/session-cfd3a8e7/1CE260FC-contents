<p>The Symbiosis & Resilience Lab investigates how ecological interactions, from host–microbe partnerships to herbivory and top-predator dynamics, shape the structure, functioning, and resilience of coral reefs and other tropical marine ecosystems in a changing ocean.</p>

<h2>🔬 Our Research</h2>

<h3>Ecological versatility and the persistence of coral reef communities</h3>

<p>Species-rich coral reefs are sustained by complex ecological interactions and fine-scale partitioning of resources. While specialization can reduce competition and promote coexistence in undisturbed environments, it may also make species vulnerable when conditions shift or resources decline. Our research examines how reef-associated fishes and invertebrates with apparent specializations can switch to alternative resources as a mechanism to cope with changing environments. By studying the degree and consequences of trophic and functional versatility, we aim to understand how species and communities will persist on the coral reefs of the Anthropocene.</p>

<h3>The role of microbes in mediating how marine animals cope with environmental change</h3>

<p>The diverse assemblages of bacteria, archaea, unicellular eukaryotes, and viruses that form microbiomes play critical roles in the health of marine animals and may also facilitate host responses to both local (e.g., deoxygenation, pollution) and global stressors (e.g., warming, acidification). Because microbiome composition can shift rapidly through the gain, loss, or replacement of taxa, and microbial genomes evolve quickly through mutation and gene exchange, these communities may represent a powerful source of ecological and evolutionary innovation that can support host adaptive responses. Our research investigates how microbes influence host traits, and how hosts, in turn, shape their microbiomes, across ecological and evolutionary timescales in diverse taxa including corals and fishes.</p>

<h3>Hidden biodiversity and ecological patterns through environmental DNA</h3>

<p>Most marine species remain undescribed and difficult to distinguish, particularly the small and cryptic organisms that dominate tropical ecosystems. Because of this, fundamental ecological data, such as species distributions, habitat associations, and vulnerability to environmental change, are still poorly known. To address these knowledge gaps, we use environmental DNA (eDNA), broadly defined as any DNA collected from an environmental sample, to uncover patterns of taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity across tropical coastal habitats. This work provides critical insights for the conservation of endangered species and the management of exploited marine resources.</p>
